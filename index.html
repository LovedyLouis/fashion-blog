    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week" target="_blank"><button
        class="mui-btn">NYFW</button></a> can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially if youâ€™ve
    never been. Luckily, Iâ€™m here to give you an insiderâ€™s guide and make your first show a pleasurable experience. By
    taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut, youâ€™ll have an unforgettable experience!

  <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>

  <p>If youâ€™re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasnâ€™t so lucky or connected my first
    2 years so Iâ€™m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and
    this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If youâ€™re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you wonâ€™t have fun. Then
    check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets
    and get excited!</p>

  <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

  <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you donâ€™t youâ€™ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show.
    Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their
    new lines. Also itâ€™s important to wear shoes youâ€™ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but
    youâ€™ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
